Given an undirected graph, the question is to color its edges with colors 0, 1, and 2 such that the sum of colors of all edges is minimized. Additionally, for every edge that is colored with 0, there must exist a neighboring edge that is colored with 2. Two edges are considered neighbors if they share a common vertex. The task is to find the minimum sum of colors for the edges in the given graph.

- COLOR every edge with 1
- LOOP A
    - SET MAX = 0
    - SET MAXEdge = anything
    - LOOP E over edges with color 1
        - SET S = 0
        - LOOP e over edges to the vertices at each end of E
            - IF e connects to a leaf ( vertex with degree 1 )
               - CONTINUE
            - IF e is not colored 1
               - CONTINUE
            - SET S = S + 1
        - ENDLOOP e
        - IF S > MAX
            - SET MAX = S
            - SET MAXEdge = E
    - ENDLOOP E
    - IF MAX == 0
        - OUTPUT sum of all edge colors
        - STOP
    - COLOR MAXEdge with color 2
    - LOOP e over edges to the vertices at each end of MAXEdge
        - IF e color == 1
             - COLOR e with 0
- ENDLOOP A
